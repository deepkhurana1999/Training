# Synopsis
* A multi-floor building has a Lift in it.

* People are queued on different floors waiting for the Lift.

* Some people want to go up. Some people want to go down.

* The floor they want to go to is represented by a number (i.e. when they enter the Lift this is the button they will press)

# Rules

## Lift Rules
* The Lift only goes up or down!
* Each floor has both UP and DOWN Lift-call buttons (except top and ground floors which have only DOWN and UP respectively)
* The Lift never changes direction until there are no more people wanting to get on/off in the direction it is already travelling
* When empty the Lift tries to be smart. For example,
* If it was going up then it may continue up to collect the highest floor person wanting to go down
* If it was going down then it may continue down to collect the lowest floor person wanting to go up
* The Lift has a maximum capacity of people
* When called, the Lift will stop at a floor even if it is full, although unless somebody gets off nobody else can get on!
* If the lift is empty, and no people are waiting, then it will return to the ground floor
## People Rules
* People are in "queues" that represent their order of arrival to wait for the Lift
* All people can press the UP/DOWN Lift-call buttons
* Only people going the same direction as the Lift may enter it
* Entry is according to the "queue" order, but those unable to enter do not block those behind them that can
* If a person is unable to enter a full Lift, they will press the UP/DOWN Lift-call button again after it has departed without them
# Kata Task
* Get all the people to the floors they want to go to while obeying the Lift rules and the People rules
* Return a list of all floors that the Lift stopped at (in the order visited!)
* NOTE: The Lift always starts on the ground floor (and people waiting on the ground floor may enter immediately)

# I/O
## Input
* queues a list of queues of people for all floors of the building.
* The height of the building varies
* 0 = the ground floor
* Not all floors have queues
* Queue index [0] is the "head" of the queue
* Numbers indicate which floor the person wants go to
* capacity maximum number of people allowed in the lift

Parameter validation - All input parameters can be assumed OK. No need to check for things like:
* People wanting to go to floors that do not exist
* People wanting to take the Lift to the floor they are already on
* Buildings with < 2 floors
* Basements
## Output
A list of all floors that the Lift stopped at (in the order visited!)
